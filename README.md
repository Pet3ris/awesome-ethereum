# What is this?

[Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org) is a blockchain application platform. Imagine a world where a *block* is a version of some code that runs when it is called upon, and these can be chained together to create more complex applications.

This list intends on providing a summarized version for anyone interested in learning how to create, manage, and even make a living creating distrubuted applications using Ethereum.
